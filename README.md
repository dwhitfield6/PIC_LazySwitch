# PIC_LazySwitch
Automated RF light switch.

This firmware reads an RF signal (315MHz) and activates a dc motor if the command is correct. There is also an IR receiver
that reads NEC codes and checks for a correct code. The code is programmed by holding down a puchbutton switch and sending
the system an IR signal (like from a TV remote).
